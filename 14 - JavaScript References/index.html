  <title>JavsScript 30: Copy vs Reference</title>
</head>
<body>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2) 
    // => 100, 100
    age = 200; 
	console.log(age, age2)
	 // => 200, 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // team is a REFERENCE to original array
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:


    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // both arrays change

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team4[3] = 'test';
    // original array stays untuched

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects

    const person = {
    	name: 'Olga',
    	age: 30
    };

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // made a reference not a copy ! original object changes


    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const futureOlga = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 31});
    console.log(person, futureOlga);
    // only captain2 is changed

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.


    // Another option:
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    dev.name = "Helga";
    // original object doesn't change

    // Check possible performance issues
